I am [Serra Hunter](https://recercaiuniversitats.gencat.cat/ca/serra-hunter/inici/) Associate Professor of Political Science and Director of the [Master's Program in Political Science](https://master-ciencia-politica.uab.cat/) at [Universitat Aut√≤noma de Barcelona](https://www.uab.cat). I am currently affiliated with the research group [Democracy, Elections and Citizenship](https://webs.uab.cat/grdec/) and the [Institute of Government and Public Policy](https://igop.uab.cat/en/), both at UAB.

My research is in the areas of political behavior, gender studies, and, more recently, social policy. I have examined how party strategies, institutional contexts, and socioeconomic and gender-based inequalities condition the quality of political representation in European democracies. I have two ongoing projects that exploree the impact of family and labor market policy on gender-based inequalities in Spain. My research is grounded in social psychological theory, with a strong emphasis on developing original measurement tools and identifying causal relationships. I have participated in original data collection endeavours, including the 16-wave (and counting!) [Spanish POLAT longitudinal panel](https://webs.uab.cat/grdec/panel-polat/), the two-wave [FAIRLEAVE logitudinal panel](https://webs.uab.cat/fairleave/wp-content/uploads/sites/401/2023/03/Cuestionario-para-web.pdf) among recent Spanish parents, as well as original survey and field experiments in Spain, the US, the UK, and Sweden.

I received my Doctorate from the [Department of Political Science at Indiana University-Bloomington](https://polisci.indiana.edu/), with a Ph.D. Minor in Psychology. My dissertation, supervised by [Tim Hellwig](https://sites.google.com/view/thellwig/home), was published as an [award-winning book manuscript](https://cses.org/2017/06/23/marinova/) titled *Coping with Complexity: How Voters Adapt to Unstable Parties* (ECPR Press, 2016).

On this site you can find information about my research, including recent [publications](/personal/publications/) with replication materials, [ongoing projects](/personal/projects/) and [working papers](/personal/papers/).
