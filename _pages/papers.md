**Marinova, Dani M. & [de Carvalho, Gabriela](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gabriela-De-Carvalho-5). "De-penalizing motherhood? Paternity leave’s (un)intended effects on job discrimination."**

<details>
<summary>Abstract</summary>
Job discrimination associated with motherhood has been documented across advanced capitalist economies, but we know little about the effectiveness of father-specific leave intended to redress it. Paternity leave seeks to increase and normalize men’s involvement in caregiving, challenge traditional gender norms that associate childcare primarily with mothers and reduce employer biases that penalize women for assumed caregiving responsibilities. We test this expectation for the first time by leveraging original survey data on reported discrimination by parents with children born before and after Spain’s 2021 paternity leave reform, which extended paternity leave and equalized it with maternity leave. Spain provides a compelling case to assess paternity leave’s impact, with over 80% of eligible fathers now taking paternity leave, alongside well-documented discrimination against mothers and no penalties for fathers. Results show that the reform did not reduce discrimination against mothers, who report stable rates of job discrimination before and after its implementation. Fathers, however, report significantly higher levels of job discrimination after the reform—especially in relation to hiring, termination, and workplace culture—suggesting that equal leave entitlements trigger new forms of bias against men as caregivers.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
This manuscript investigates whether equal and non-transferable paternity leave can promote more equitable caregiving within couples. Exploiting a natural experiment created by Spain’s 2021 paternity leave reform—which established a 16-week leave entitlement equal to maternity leave—we analyze its effects on fathers’ involvement in both physical and cognitive childcare. Drawing on an original two-wave survey of over 3,400 partnered parents of children born between 2018 and 2022, we estimate short- and medium-term impacts of increasing paternity leave duration. Results show modest gains in fathers’ participation in physical care during the early months following birth, but these effects dissipate after return to work. No significant shifts are observed in the distribution of cognitive labor, which remains disproportionately shouldered by mothers. Effects do not vary significantly by birth order or socioeconomic status. Our findings suggest that even under ideal policy conditions—equal, well-paid, non-transferable leave entitlements—progress toward gender-equal caregiving is limited. The study highlights the persistence of traditional gender roles, particularly in mental and anticipatory care tasks, and calls for broader institutional and cultural change beyond parental leave policy.
